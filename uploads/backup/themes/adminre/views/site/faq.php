Being a non-profit, it was tight on budget and needed to build an app quickly to show progress to investors. They reached out to VenturePact with a rough idea of their requirement. VenturePact helped them define their requirements more clearly and found 3 service providers that had experience in payments and fit Lend for America's budget requirements. The 3 service providers pitched and Lend for America selected a company in India. The app was completed on time and within budget and the company had a successful launch of the product.
