					<h1>Why <strong class="orange">Gudaak ?</strong></h1> 
					<p>Today students know what they learn but "WHY?" is a question never asked or replied to.  So here we are, to awaken our Gen Z from the deep slumber of ignorance and give them a focussed approach to life. We follow a very simple and holistic approach towards students' career decisions.<br/><br/>
We believe it should be a well thought and well informed choice so that a student takes his/her first step on his/her career path very confidently which will help him/her in writing their own success story.

										This step consists of psychometric assessment followed by the personalized Counselling and Career Recommendations. Psychometric assessment analyse students’ personality and interest area which gives us an insight about the shortlisted career options that could interest students.
Now, we do not want students to make their career decisions just on the basis of our recommendations rather we believe student should learn about the recommended career and if they already have any career choice in their mind, which leads them to next step.
